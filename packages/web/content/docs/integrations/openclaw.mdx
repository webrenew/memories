description: Integrate memories.sh with OpenClaw.
---

[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) is an open-source personal AI assistant. Its current onboarding flow imports `AGENTS.md` and skill files into `~/.openclaw/workspace`, so the clean memories.sh integration path is to generate those artifacts from your memory store.

## Why memories.sh + OpenClaw

Adding memories.sh gives you:

- **Cross-tool portability** — Rules and decisions you keep for OpenClaw also power Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other integrations
- **Structured memory store** — Keep rules, decisions, and facts in one searchable local database
- **Reusable skills** — Generate `.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md` once and reuse across agent ecosystems

## Recommended Setup (Workspace-First)

### 1) Run OpenClaw onboarding once

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

This creates and configures your OpenClaw workspace (default: `~/.openclaw/workspace`).

### 2) Generate memories.sh output for OpenClaw

From your project (where your memories are scoped):

```bash
cd your-project
memories init
memories generate claude -o ~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md
memories generate agents
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills
cp -R .agents/skills/. ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/
```

This writes:
1. `AGENTS.md` into OpenClaw's workspace for session instructions
2. `SKILL.md` files into OpenClaw's workspace `skills/` directory

### 3) Keep it in sync

Whenever memories change:

```bash
cd your-project
memories generate claude -o ~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md
memories generate agents
cp -R .agents/skills/. ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/
```

## Important Notes

- OpenClaw docs currently define context discovery around `AGENTS.md` and `SKILL.md` artifacts.
- OpenClaw docs currently do not document a project-level MCP config path like `.openclaw/mcp.json` for this integration flow.
- If you changed your workspace path in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (for example `agent.workspace` or `agents.defaults.workspace`), replace `~/.openclaw/workspace` with your configured path.

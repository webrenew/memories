title: Factory (Droid)
description: Integrate memories.sh with Factory's Droid CLI.
---

[Factory](https://factory.ai/) provides Droid, an AI coding agent that runs in your terminal and IDE. Droid reads instructions from `.factory/` configuration and supports MCP servers.

## Quick Setup

```bash
cd your-project
memories init
```

This automatically:
1. Sets up your local memory store
2. Configures MCP for supported tools
3. Generates instruction files with your existing memories

## Manual Setup

### Option 1: Generated File

Generate instructions for Droid:

```bash
memories generate factory
```

Droid will read this file and incorporate your rules, decisions, and facts into its context.

### Option 2: MCP Server

Add memories.sh to Factory's MCP configuration. Create or edit `.factory/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

For global configuration (applies to all projects), add to `~/.factory/mcp.json`.

### Recommended: Use Both

1. **Generated file** — Provides instructions Droid always sees
2. **MCP server** — Gives Droid live access to search, recall, and add memories

## Syncing Factory Config

To sync your Factory/Droid configuration across machines:

```bash
# On your main machine
memories files ingest

# On a new machine
memories files apply --global --force
```

This syncs:
- `.factory/config.json` — Droid configuration
- `.factory/instructions.md` — Custom instructions
- `.factory/droids/*.md` — Custom droid definitions
- `.factory/tasks/*.md` — Task definitions
- `.factory/skills/**/*` — Skills and references

## Factory-Specific Features

### Custom Droids

Factory allows creating custom droids with specialized behaviors. These are stored in `.factory/droids/` and synced automatically:

```bash
# Import your custom droids
memories files ingest

# Apply on another machine
memories files apply --global
```

### Tasks

Project task files (`.factory/tasks/*.md`) help Droid understand ongoing work:

```bash
# Import project tasks
memories files ingest --project

# Apply on another machine
cd your-project
memories files apply --project
```

### Skills

Factory skills (`.factory/skills/**/*`) provide reusable agent capabilities. These are synced with `memories files` just like other configuration.

## Using with Factory Cloud

If you use Factory's cloud features alongside memories.sh:

1. **Local memories** — Use memories.sh for rules and decisions you want across all tools
2. **Factory cloud** — Use Factory's built-in features for Droid-specific context
3. **Sync both** — Run `memories files ingest` to capture Factory configs in memories.sh

This gives you portability while still using Factory's native features.

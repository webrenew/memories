description: Integrate memories.sh with Cline.
---

Cline reads rules from `.clinerules/` and supports MCP servers.

## Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate cline
```

This creates `.clinerules/memories.md` with your rules and context.

## Option 2: MCP Server

Add memories.sh to Cline's MCP configuration in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "memories",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Migrating Existing Rules

```bash
memories ingest cline
```

description: Integrate memories.sh with Gemini.
---

Gemini reads instructions from `GEMINI.md` in the project root.

## Generated File

```bash
memories generate gemini
```

This creates a `GEMINI.md` file in your project root with your rules, decisions, and facts. Gemini reads this automatically.

## Migrating Existing Instructions

If you have an existing `GEMINI.md`:

```bash
memories ingest gemini
```

## Note on MCP

Gemini does not currently support MCP servers. Use the generated file approach for Gemini integration.

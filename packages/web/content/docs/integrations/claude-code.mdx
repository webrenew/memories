description: Integrate memories.sh with Claude Code.
---

Claude Code reads project instructions from `CLAUDE.md` in the project root and supports MCP servers.

## Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate claude
```

This creates a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root with all your rules, decisions, and facts. Claude Code reads this automatically.

## Option 2: MCP Server

Add memories.sh to your Claude Code MCP configuration. Edit `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (or your project's `.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "memories",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

If memories.sh is not installed globally, use npx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Using Both

You can use both methods together. The generated `CLAUDE.md` provides a static baseline, while the MCP server gives Claude live access to search for specific context and add new memories.

description: Integrate memories.sh with Cursor.
---

Cursor reads project rules from `.cursor/rules/` and supports MCP servers. memories.sh integrates with both.

## Quick Setup

The fastest way to set up memories.sh with Cursor:

```bash
cd your-project
memories init
```

This automatically:
1. Detects Cursor (looks for `.cursor/` directory)
2. Configures MCP in `.cursor/mcp.json`
3. Generates `.cursor/rules/memories.mdc` with your existing memories

## Manual Setup

### Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate cursor
```

This creates `.cursor/rules/memories.mdc` — an MDC (Markdown Components) file with YAML frontmatter that Cursor reads as a project rule.

The generated file includes:
- All your rules, decisions, and facts
- Instructions for Cursor to save new memories via MCP

### Option 2: MCP Server

Add memories.sh to Cursor's MCP configuration.

**Project-level** (`.cursor/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Global** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Recommended: Use Both

Using both methods together gives the best experience:

1. **Generated file** — Provides a static baseline that's always available
2. **MCP server** — Gives Cursor live access to search and add memories

## Migrating Existing Rules

If you have existing rules in `.cursorrules` or `.cursor/rules/`, you can import them:

```bash
memories ingest cursor
```

This extracts individual rules from your existing Cursor config and stores them as memories. You can then manage them with memories.sh and generate updated files for all your tools.

## Syncing Cursor Config

To sync your Cursor configuration (MCP config, rules) across machines:

```bash
# On your main machine
memories files ingest

# On a new machine
memories files apply --global --force
```

This syncs:
- `.cursor/mcp.json` — Your MCP server configurations
- `.cursor/rules/*.md` — Your rule files
- `.cursor/skills/**/*` — Any skills you've created

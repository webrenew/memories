description: Integrate memories.sh with Cursor.
---

Cursor reads project rules from `.cursor/rules/` and supports MCP servers.

## Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate cursor
```

This creates `.cursor/rules/memories.mdc` — an MDC (Markdown Components) file with YAML frontmatter that Cursor reads as a project rule.

## Option 2: MCP Server

Add memories.sh to Cursor's MCP configuration. In Cursor, open Settings and navigate to the MCP section, then add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "memories",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Migrating Existing Rules

If you have existing rules in `.cursorrules` or `.cursor/rules/`, you can import them:

```bash
memories ingest cursor
```

This extracts individual rules from your existing Cursor config and stores them as memories. You can then manage them with memories.sh and generate updated files for all your tools.

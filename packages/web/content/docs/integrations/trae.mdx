description: Integrate memories.sh with Trae by ByteDance.
---

[Trae](https://trae.ai/) is ByteDance's coding agent with built-in MCP support. It reads project rules and provides AI-assisted development workflows.

## Quick Setup

```bash
cd your-project
memories init
```

This automatically:
1. Sets up your local memory store
2. Configures MCP for supported tools
3. Generates instruction files with your existing memories

## Manual Setup

### Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate agents
```

This creates the canonical `.agents/` directory that Trae reads for project context.

### Option 2: MCP Server

Trae has built-in MCP support. Configure it through the IDE's MCP settings, or add to `.trae/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

If your Trae install uses a home-level config, place the same file at `~/.trae/mcp.json`.

### Recommended: Use Both

1. **Generated file** — Provides instructions Trae always sees
2. **MCP server** — Gives Trae live access to search, recall, and add memories

## Syncing Trae Config

To sync your Trae configuration across machines:

```bash
# On your main machine
memories files ingest

# On a new machine
memories files apply --global --force
```

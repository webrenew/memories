description: Integrate memories.sh with Roo.
---

Roo reads rules from `.roo/rules/` and supports MCP servers.

## Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate roo
```

This creates `.roo/rules/memories.md` with your rules and context.

## Option 2: MCP Server

Add memories.sh to Roo's MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "memories",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Migrating Existing Rules

```bash
memories ingest roo
```

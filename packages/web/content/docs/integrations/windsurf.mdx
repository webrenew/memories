description: Integrate memories.sh with Windsurf.
---

Windsurf reads rules from `.windsurf/rules/` and supports MCP servers.

## Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate windsurf
```

This creates `.windsurf/rules/memories.md`. Note that Windsurf has a **6000 character limit** for rule files — content is automatically truncated if it exceeds this.

## Option 2: MCP Server

Add memories.sh to Windsurf's MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "memories",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Migrating Existing Rules

Import from existing Windsurf rules (checks both `.windsurf/rules/` and legacy `.windsurfrules`):

```bash
memories ingest windsurf
```

## Character Limit

Windsurf enforces a 6000 character limit on rule files. If your memories exceed this, the generated file is truncated. Rules are prioritized over other memory types. Consider using the MCP server for full access to all memories.

description: Integrate memories.sh with Antigravity IDE.
---

[Antigravity](https://antigravity.dev/) is Google's agent-first IDE powered by Gemini. It provides an integrated development environment with AI assistance built in.

## Quick Setup

```bash
cd your-project
memories init
```

This automatically:
1. Sets up your local memory store
2. Configures MCP for supported tools
3. Generates instruction files with your existing memories

## Manual Setup

### Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate agents
```

This creates the canonical `.agents/` directory that Antigravity reads for project context.

### Option 2: MCP Server

Antigravity has built-in MCP support. Add memories.sh through the IDE's MCP settings, or create `.antigravity/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

If your Antigravity install stores MCP config under Gemini state, use `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json` with the same `mcpServers` shape.

### Recommended: Use Both

1. **Generated file** — Provides instructions Antigravity always sees
2. **MCP server** — Gives Antigravity live access to search, recall, and add memories

## Syncing Antigravity Config

To sync your Antigravity configuration across machines:

```bash
# On your main machine
memories files ingest

# On a new machine
memories files apply --global --force
```

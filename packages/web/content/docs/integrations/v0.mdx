[v0](https://v0.dev/) is Vercel's AI-powered tool for generating React components and UI. Connect v0 to memories.sh to access your rules and context.

## Setup

### 1. Get Your API Key

1. Sign up or log in at [memories.sh/app/api-keys](https://memories.sh/app/api-keys)
2. In the dashboard, find the **MCP API Key** section
3. Click **Generate API Key**
4. Copy the key (you won't see it again)

### 2. Configure v0

In v0's MCP settings, add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "url": "https://memories.sh/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you generated.

### 3. Verify Connection

Test the connection:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://memories.sh/api/mcp
# Should return: {"status":"ok","name":"memories.sh MCP Server","version":"0.6.0"}
```

## Using with v0

Once connected, v0 can access your memories:

**Get context for a task:**
```
Search my memories for React component patterns
```

**Save new learnings:**
```
Save this as a rule: "Use Tailwind's cn() helper for conditional classes"
```

**Recall decisions:**
```
What decisions have I made about design system components?
```

## Available Tools

The hosted MCP server provides these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_context` | Get rules and relevant memories |
| `add_memory` | Store a new memory (rule, decision, fact, note, skill) |
| `search_memories` | Search by content |
| `get_rules` | Get all active rules |
| `list_memories` | List recent memories |
| `edit_memory` | Update an existing memory |
| `forget_memory` | Soft-delete a memory |
| `bulk_forget_memories` | Bulk soft-delete by filter |
| `vacuum_memories` | Permanently purge soft-deleted memories |

## Syncing with CLI

Memories added via v0 sync to your cloud database. To access them locally:

```bash
# Login (if not already)
memories login

# Enable sync
memories sync enable

# Pull latest memories
memories sync pull
```

Now your memories are available both in v0 and your local CLI/IDE tools.

## Managing Your API Key

In the [API Keys dashboard page](https://memories.sh/app/api-keys):

- **Regenerate** — Create a new key (invalidates the old one)
- **Revoke** — Delete the key entirely

<Callout type="info">
API keys are tied to your account. Anyone with your key can read and write to your memories.
</Callout>

## Alternative: Local Server (Development)

For local development without cloud sync, you can run a local MCP server:

```bash
memories serve --sse --port 3030
```

Then configure v0 to connect to `http://localhost:3030/mcp` (no auth required for localhost).

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

- Check your API key is correct
- Ensure the `Authorization` header includes `Bearer ` prefix
- Regenerate your key in the dashboard

### No memories found

- Verify you have memories: `memories list`
- Check sync is enabled: `memories sync status`
- Push local memories to cloud: `memories sync push`

### v0 not using my rules

Make sure your rules are synced to the cloud:
```bash
memories sync push
```

Then verify in the dashboard that your rules appear.

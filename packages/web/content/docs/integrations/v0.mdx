description: Integrate memories.sh with v0's AI coding assistant.
---

[v0](https://v0.dev/) is Vercel's AI-powered coding assistant for building React components. Since v0 runs in a web browser, it can't use the standard stdio MCP transport. Instead, you can use the HTTP/SSE transport or export your memories as context.

## Current Options

### Option 1: Export Context (Available Now)

The simplest approach is to export your memories and paste them into v0:

```bash
# Generate a context prompt
memories prompt > context.md

# Or export as structured data
memories export --format yaml > memories.yaml
```

Then paste the contents into v0's chat as context:

```
Here are my coding rules and project context:

[paste contents of context.md]

Now, please build a...
```

### Option 2: Use with v0's CLI

If you're using v0's CLI locally, you can generate a context file that v0 reads:

```bash
# Generate context for v0
memories generate agents -o v0-context.md
```

Then reference this file when working with v0.

## SSE Transport (Coming Soon)

<Callout type="info">
**Coming in a future release**: Native SSE transport for web-based MCP clients.
</Callout>

We're working on adding SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport to the memories MCP server. This will allow web-based tools like v0 to connect directly:

```bash
# Future command
memories serve --sse --port 3030
```

Once available, you'll be able to configure v0's MCP settings to connect to your local server, enabling live access to search and add memories.

### Why SSE?

Web-based AI tools can't spawn local processes, so the standard stdio MCP transport doesn't work. SSE provides an HTTP-based transport that works from anywhere:

- **stdio** — Standard for desktop apps (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)
- **SSE** — Required for web apps (v0, web-based IDEs)

## Workaround: mcp-proxy

Until native SSE support is added, you can use [mcp-proxy](https://github.com/anthropics/mcp-proxy) to bridge stdio to SSE:

```bash
# Install mcp-proxy
npm install -g @anthropic/mcp-proxy

# Run memories via the proxy
mcp-proxy --port 3030 -- memories serve
```

Then configure v0 to connect to `http://localhost:3030`.

<Callout type="warn">
**Security Note**: Exposing MCP over HTTP makes your memories accessible to anything that can reach that port. Only run on trusted networks.
</Callout>

## Best Practices for v0

### 1. Keep context focused

v0 works best with focused context. Instead of dumping all memories:

```bash
# Search for relevant memories
memories search "react component" --json | head -10
```

### 2. Use the prompt command

The `prompt` command formats memories specifically for AI consumption:

```bash
memories prompt --types rule,decision
```

This outputs a clean, structured prompt ready to paste.

### 3. Save v0's learnings

After v0 helps you build something, save any conventions it established:

```bash
memories add --rule "Use Tailwind's cn() helper for conditional classes"
memories add --decision "Chose shadcn/ui Button component for all buttons"
```

These will be available for future v0 sessions.

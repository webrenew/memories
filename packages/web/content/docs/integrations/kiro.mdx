description: Integrate memories.sh with Kiro IDE.
---

[Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) is AWS's agentic AI IDE with CLI support and autonomous agents. It reads project instructions and supports MCP servers.

## Quick Setup

```bash
cd your-project
memories init
```

This automatically:
1. Sets up your local memory store
2. Configures MCP for supported tools
3. Generates instruction files with your existing memories

## Manual Setup

### Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate agents
```

This creates the canonical `.agents/` directory that Kiro reads for project context.

### Option 2: MCP Server

Add memories.sh to Kiro's MCP configuration. Create or edit `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

For home-level setup, use `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`.

### Recommended: Use Both

1. **Generated file** — Provides instructions Kiro always sees
2. **MCP server** — Gives Kiro live access to search, recall, and add memories

## Syncing Kiro Config

To sync your Kiro configuration across machines:

```bash
# On your main machine
memories files ingest

# On a new machine
memories files apply --global --force
```

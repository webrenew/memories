description: One memory store for all your AI coding tools. Store rules, decisions, and knowledge once — generate native config files for every AI editor.

## What is memories.sh?

**memories.sh** is a local-first CLI tool that gives your AI coding agents persistent memory. Store your coding rules, architectural decisions, and project knowledge in a single local database, then generate native configuration files for Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and more.

## Why memories.sh?

If you use multiple AI coding tools, you know the pain of maintaining separate rule files for each one. Change a rule in `.cursorrules` and forget to update `CLAUDE.md`. Add a decision to one tool and it's invisible to the others.

memories.sh solves this by being the **single source of truth** for all your AI agent context:

- **One store, every tool** — Add a memory once, generate files for all your tools
- **Local-first** — Your data stays on your machine in a SQLite database
- **MCP server** — Connect directly to any MCP-compatible AI tool
- **Git-aware** — Memories automatically scope to the current project
- **Type system** — Categorize memories as rules, decisions, facts, or notes

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @memories.sh/cli

# Add your first rule
memories add --rule "Always use TypeScript strict mode"

# Add a decision
memories add --decision "Chose PostgreSQL over MySQL for JSONB support"

# Generate config files for all your tools
memories generate all

# Or start the MCP server
memories serve
```

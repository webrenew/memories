The memories.sh MCP server exposes 3 resources that AI tools can read to access your memories.

## memories://rules

All active rules formatted as markdown, split by global and project scope.

```
URI: memories://rules
```

Returns a markdown document with sections for global rules and project rules:

```markdown
## Global Rules
- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Use conventional commits

## Project Rules
- Use pnpm as the package manager
- Prefer Server Components by default
```

## memories://recent

The 20 most recent memories across all types.

```
URI: memories://recent
```

Returns recent memories ordered by creation date, including their type, scope, and content.

## memories://project/\{projectId\}

All memories for a specific project. This is a template resource — replace `{projectId}` with the actual project identifier.

```
URI: memories://project/github.com/user/repo
```

Returns all active memories scoped to the specified project, including all types.

The project ID format matches what `memories doctor` or `memories stats` reports — typically `github.com/user/repo` (see [Project Detection](/docs/concepts/project-detection)).

title: MCP Server
description: Fallback real-time access for agents that need more than static configs.
---

The primary way to use memories.sh is the CLI — `memories generate` writes native config files that each tool reads natively. For browser-based agents (v0, bolt.new, Lovable) or any MCP client where the CLI can't run, the built-in MCP server provides real-time access.

<Callout>
If you are building a SaaS app and already using SDK endpoints (`/api/sdk/v1/*`), you usually do not need MCP.
Use MCP when your product must serve MCP-native clients directly.

## When to Use the MCP Server

Use `memories generate` first. The MCP server is useful when:

- **Browser-based agents** — v0, bolt.new, Lovable, and other tools where the CLI can't run
- Agents need to **add new memories** during a conversation
- You want **live search** without regenerating files
- You want both — generated files for rules, MCP for real-time context

## Cloud MCP (Recommended)

For signed-up users, the easiest way to connect is via our hosted MCP endpoint. This works with any tool that supports HTTP-based MCP.

### 1. Generate an API Key

Get your API key from the [API Keys dashboard page](/app/api-keys) or run:

```bash
memories login
```

### 2. Configure Your Tool

See the [MCP Integration Guide](/docs/integrations/mcp) for tool-specific setup instructions, including:

- **Cursor** — One-click install or manual config
- **Claude Code** — CLI command
- **Claude Desktop** — Config file
- **Windsurf** — Config file
- **VS Code** — Config file
- **v0 / Web Tools** — Paste endpoint URL

<Callout>
Cloud MCP syncs memories across all your devices and doesn't require the CLI to be running locally.
</Callout>

## Local MCP (Self-Hosted)

For local-only use or self-hosted setups, run the MCP server locally via stdio:

```bash
memories serve
```

Configure your tool to spawn the local server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

The local server communicates over stdio and logs diagnostic information to stderr.

## Available Tools and Resources

The MCP server exposes:

- **9 tools** — for reading, writing, searching, and managing memories
- **3 resources** — for accessing rules, recent memories, and project-specific data

See the [Tools Reference](/docs/mcp-server/tools-reference), [Resources Reference](/docs/mcp-server/resources-reference), and [Tenant Routing](/docs/mcp-server/tenant-routing) for complete documentation.

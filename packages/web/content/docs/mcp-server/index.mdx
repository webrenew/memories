title: MCP Server
description: Connect memories directly to AI tools via the Model Context Protocol.
---

memories.sh includes a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows AI tools to read and write memories directly, without generating intermediate files.

**MCP Endpoint**

```txt title="Endpoint URL"
https://memories.sh/api/mcp
```

## Why Use the MCP Server?

While `memories generate` creates static files, the MCP server provides **live access** to your memories:

- AI agents can **search** for relevant context based on the current task
- Agents can **add new memories** as they learn about your project
- No need to regenerate files when memories change
- Works alongside generated files — use both approaches together

## Cloud MCP (Recommended)

For signed-up users, the easiest way to connect is via our hosted MCP endpoint. This works with any tool that supports HTTP-based MCP.

### 1. Generate an API Key

Get your API key from the [dashboard](/app) or run:

```bash
memories login
```

### 2. Configure Your Tool

Add to your tool's MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "url": "https://memories.sh/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key from your dashboard.

<Callout>
Cloud MCP syncs memories across all your devices and doesn't require the CLI to be running locally.
</Callout>

## Local MCP (Self-Hosted)

For local-only use or self-hosted setups, run the MCP server locally via stdio:

```bash
memories serve
```

Configure your tool to spawn the local server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

The local server communicates over stdio and logs diagnostic information to stderr.

## Available Tools and Resources

The MCP server exposes:

- **7 tools** — for reading, writing, searching, and managing memories
- **3 resources** — for accessing rules, recent memories, and project-specific data

See the [Tools Reference](/docs/mcp-server/tools-reference) and [Resources Reference](/docs/mcp-server/resources-reference) for complete documentation.

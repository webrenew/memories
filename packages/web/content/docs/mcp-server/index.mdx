title: MCP Server
description: Connect memories directly to AI tools via the Model Context Protocol.
---

memories.sh includes a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows AI tools to read and write memories directly over stdio, without generating intermediate files.

## Starting the Server

```bash
memories serve
```

The server communicates over stdio using the MCP protocol. It logs diagnostic information to stderr.

## Why Use the MCP Server?

While `memories generate` creates static files, the MCP server provides **live access** to your memories:

- AI agents can **search** for relevant context based on the current task
- Agents can **add new memories** as they learn about your project
- No need to regenerate files when memories change
- Works alongside generated files — use both approaches together

## Connecting to AI Tools

Add the MCP server to your AI tool's configuration. The exact setup varies by tool — see the [Integrations](/docs/integrations) guide for specific instructions.

The general pattern is to add memories.sh as an MCP server with the command `memories serve` (or `npx @memories.sh/cli serve` if not installed globally):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "memories",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools and Resources

The MCP server exposes:

- **7 tools** — for reading, writing, searching, and managing memories
- **3 resources** — for accessing rules, recent memories, and project-specific data

See the [Tools Reference](/docs/mcp-server/tools-reference) and [Resources Reference](/docs/mcp-server/resources-reference) for complete documentation.

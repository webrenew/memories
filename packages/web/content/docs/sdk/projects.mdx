description: Create SaaS-scoped SDK projects in the dashboard and avoid tenantId vs projectId confusion.

Use this page first if you are wiring memories.sh into a SaaS app.

<Callout>
SaaS apps using SDK endpoints (`/api/sdk/v1/*`) do not need MCP multitenancy.
Use MCP routing only when you are serving MCP-native clients.

## What is an AI SDK Project?

In the dashboard, an **AI SDK Project** is a `tenantId` boundary that routes to an isolated memory database.

- One project per customer workspace, org, environment, or app surface
- Works for solo devs and teams
- Created in your currently selected dashboard workspace

## Setup Flow (Dashboard)

1. Open **Dashboard → AI SDK Projects**.
2. Generate a `mem_...` API key.
3. Use backend-derived `tenantId` values in SDK requests.
4. Runtime provisions or resolves tenant DBs automatically on first use (when server provisioning is enabled).
5. Use **Tenant Overrides** only for explicit DB attachment/provisioning control.

## Scope Cheat Sheet

| Scope field | What it isolates | Security boundary | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tenantId` | SaaS customer/project database | Yes | For multi-tenant SaaS |
| `userId` | End-user scope inside `tenantId` | Yes (within tenant) | Optional |
| `projectId` | Optional git/repo context filter | No | Optional |

## Important: `tenantId` vs `projectId`

These are different:

- `tenantId` = SaaS isolation boundary (database routing)
- `userId` = end-user scope inside `tenantId`
- `projectId` = optional repo context filter (for coding assistants)

If your app is not git-centric, omit `projectId`.

## Solo Dev Guidance

You do not need a team workspace to start.

- Stay in your personal workspace.
- Create AI SDK Projects there.
- Add team workspace later if needed.

## Server-Side Usage Pattern

Always derive scope in backend auth code, then call memories with your server key.

```ts
const client = new MemoriesClient({
  apiKey: process.env.MEMORIES_API_KEY,
  tenantId: auth.orgId, // server-derived
  userId: auth.userId,  // server-derived
})

const context = await client.context.get({
  query: "pricing and billing policy",
  projectId: undefined, // optional git context filter
})
```

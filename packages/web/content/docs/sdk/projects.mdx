description: Create SaaS-scoped SDK projects in the dashboard and avoid tenantId vs projectId confusion.

Use this page first if you are wiring memories.sh into a SaaS app.

## What is an AI SDK Project?

In the dashboard, an **AI SDK Project** is a `tenantId` mapping to an isolated memory database.

- One project per customer workspace, org, environment, or app surface
- Works for solo devs and teams
- Created in your currently selected dashboard workspace

## Setup Flow (Dashboard)

1. Open **Dashboard → AI SDK Projects**.
2. Generate a `mem_...` API key.
3. Create your first project:
   - **Attach Existing DB** (recommended): map an existing Turso database.
   - **Provision New Project DB**: create a new Turso DB from the dashboard.
4. Use that `tenantId` from your backend when calling memories.

## Scope Cheat Sheet

| Scope field | What it isolates | Security boundary | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tenantId` | SaaS customer/project database | Yes | For multi-tenant SaaS |
| `userId` | End-user scope inside `tenantId` | Yes (within tenant) | Optional |
| `projectId` | Optional git/repo context filter | No | Optional |

## Important: `tenantId` vs `projectId`

These are different:

- `tenantId` = SaaS isolation boundary (database routing)
- `userId` = end-user scope inside `tenantId`
- `projectId` = optional repo context filter (for coding assistants)

If your app is not git-centric, omit `projectId`.

## Solo Dev Guidance

You do not need a team workspace to start.

- Stay in your personal workspace.
- Create AI SDK Projects there.
- Add team workspace later if needed.

## Server-Side Usage Pattern

Always derive scope in backend auth code, then call memories with your server key.

```ts
const client = new MemoriesClient({
  apiKey: process.env.MEMORIES_API_KEY,
  tenantId: auth.orgId, // server-derived
  userId: auth.userId,  // server-derived
})

const context = await client.context.get({
  query: "pricing and billing policy",
  projectId: undefined, // optional git context filter
})
```

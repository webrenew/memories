description: Import memories from existing IDE rule files.
---

```bash
memories ingest [source] [options]
```

Scan existing IDE rule files and extract memories from them. This is the fastest way to migrate an existing setup to memories.sh.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `source` | Source name (`cursor`, `claude`, `agents`, `copilot`, `windsurf`, `cline`, `roo`, `gemini`) or a file path |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--type <type>` | Override type for all imported memories |
| `--dry-run` | Preview without importing |
| `--all` | Scan all known IDE rule file locations |
| `--no-dedup` | Skip duplicate detection |

## Examples

Ingest from a specific tool:

```bash
memories ingest cursor
memories ingest claude
```

Ingest from all known locations:

```bash
memories ingest --all
```

Preview what would be imported:

```bash
memories ingest cursor --dry-run
```

Ingest from a custom file:

```bash
memories ingest ./my-rules.md --type rule
```

## Behavior

- Extracts bullet points, numbered items, and significant plain text from rule files
- Auto-infers memory type from content keywords:
  - "always", "never", "must", "should" → `rule`
  - "chose", "decided", "because" → `decision`
  - Specific values, numbers, limits → `fact`
- Skips files that were generated by memories.sh (detected by marker comment)
- Deduplicates against existing memories using normalized content comparison
- Scans both current and legacy file locations (e.g., `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`)

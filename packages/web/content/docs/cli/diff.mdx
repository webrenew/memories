Compare the current state of your memories against the content in generated IDE rule files. Shows added and removed memories to help you decide when to regenerate.

## Arguments

|----------|-------------|
| `target` | Target to check: `cursor`, `claude`, `agents`, `copilot`, `windsurf`, `cline`, `roo`, `gemini`, or `all` |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--types <types>` | Comma-separated types to include (default: `rule,decision,fact`) |

## Examples

```bash
memories diff cursor
memories diff all
memories diff claude --types rule,decision
```

## Output

Shows a diff-like output with:
- `+` prefix for memories that are in the store but not in the generated file
- `-` prefix for content in the generated file that's no longer in the store
- Relative timestamps (e.g., "2h ago") for each change
- A warning if the file is not managed by memories.sh (missing marker comment)

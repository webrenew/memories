title: memories serve
description: Start the MCP server.
---

```bash
memories serve
```

Start the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using stdio transport. This allows MCP-compatible AI tools to read and write memories directly, without generating intermediate files.

## Usage

```bash
memories serve
```

The server starts on stdio (standard input/output), which is the transport used by most MCP client integrations. Diagnostic messages are logged to stderr to avoid interfering with the protocol.

## What It Provides

The MCP server exposes 7 tools and 3 resources. See the [MCP Server](/docs/mcp-server) documentation for the complete reference.

### Tools

- `get_context` — Get rules and relevant memories (primary tool for AI agents)
- `add_memory` — Store a new memory
- `search_memories` — Full-text search
- `get_rules` — Get all active rules
- `list_memories` — List recent memories
- `edit_memory` — Update a memory
- `forget_memory` — Soft-delete a memory

### Resources

- `memories://rules` — All active rules
- `memories://recent` — 20 most recent memories
- `memories://project/{projectId}` — All memories for a specific project

## Integration

To connect the MCP server to your AI tool, add it to the tool's MCP configuration. See the [Integrations](/docs/integrations) guide for tool-specific setup instructions.

title: memories forget
description: Soft-delete memories by ID or bulk filter.
---

```bash
memories forget [id] [options]
```

Remove memories by ID or in bulk using filters. Memories are soft-deleted (marked with a `deleted_at` timestamp) and excluded from all queries. Use `memories doctor --fix` to permanently purge soft-deleted records.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Memory ID to forget (omit for bulk operations) |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--type <type>` | Forget all memories of this type |
| `--tag <tag>` | Forget all memories with this tag |
| `--older-than <days>` | Forget memories older than N days |
| `--pattern <pattern>` | Forget memories matching pattern (use `*` as wildcard) |
| `--all` | Forget ALL memories (requires `--force` or confirmation) |
| `--project-only` | Only forget project-scoped memories |
| `--dry-run` | Preview what would be deleted |
| `--force` | Skip confirmation prompt |

## Examples

Forget a single memory:

```bash
memories forget abc123def456
```

Preview what would be deleted:

```bash
memories forget --type note --dry-run
```

Forget all notes older than 30 days:

```bash
memories forget --type note --older-than 30
```

Forget memories matching a pattern:

```bash
memories forget --pattern "TODO*"
```

Forget everything (with confirmation):

```bash
memories forget --all
```

## Behavior

- Single-ID mode does a direct soft-delete without confirmation
- Bulk mode requires at least one filter option
- Previews up to 30 matching memories before asking for confirmation
- `--all` cannot be combined with other filters
- Large deletions are batched in chunks of 500
- Soft-deleted memories can be permanently purged with `memories doctor --fix`

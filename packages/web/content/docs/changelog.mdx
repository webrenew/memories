## February 21, 2026

- Added cron reminder support in CLI via `memories reminders` (`add`, `list`, `run`, `enable`, `disable`, `delete`).
- Added local CLI MCP reminder tools: `add_reminder`, `list_reminders`, `run_due_reminders`, `enable_reminder`, `disable_reminder`, `delete_reminder`.
- Published reminder docs in CLI reference and MCP references, including local-only reminder tooling guidance.
- Added first-class `memory` graph nodes (`node_type = memory`, `node_key = memory_id`) with `self` links so each memory is directly addressable in graph traversal.
- Updated graph mapping cleanup to remove edges attached to deleted memory nodes, not only edges where the memory is listed as evidence.
- Extended `vacuum_memories` cleanup to prune graph mappings for purged soft-deleted memories.
- Added embedding-driven `similar_to` graph edges between memory nodes (bidirectional) using cosine thresholding and per-memory caps.
- Added similarity edge controls: `SIMILARITY_EDGE_THRESHOLD`, `SIMILARITY_EDGE_MAX_K`, `SIMILARITY_EDGE_MAX_PER_MEMORY`.
- Added optional LLM relationship extraction for ambiguous similarity matches to create `contradicts` and `supersedes` memory edges.
- Added graph LLM controls: `GRAPH_LLM_AMBIGUOUS_SIMILARITY_MIN`, `GRAPH_LLM_AMBIGUOUS_SIMILARITY_MAX`, `GRAPH_LLM_RELATIONSHIP_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, `GRAPH_LLM_RELATIONSHIP_MODEL_ID`.
- Added relationship-aware graph ranking weights by edge type (`caused_by`, `contradicts`, `supersedes`, `similar_to`, etc.) with confidence + hop decay in retrieval scoring.
- Added `conflicts` to `get_context` responses when returned memories are linked by `contradicts` edges, including confidence and clarification suggestions.
- Added semantic LLM relationship extraction on writes for `caused_by`, `prefers_over`, `depends_on`, `specializes`, and `conditional_on` edges (with reusable `condition` graph nodes).
- Made relationship edge replacement atomic via savepoint rollback in graph upsert (`replaceMemoryRelationshipEdges`) to prevent partial edge loss on write failures.
- Added structured LLM extraction degradation reporting in embedding worker metrics (`GRAPH_RELATIONSHIP_PARTIAL_DEGRADE`) with issue-level codes (`GRAPH_LLM_CLASSIFICATION_FAILED`, `GRAPH_LLM_SEMANTIC_EXTRACTION_FAILED`).
- Clarified embedding observability/operations docs so graph extraction degradation is mapped to `worker.topErrorCodes` with structured issue summary format.
- Optimized graph-only retry path after `GRAPH_RELATIONSHIP_SYNC_FAILED` to reuse stored embeddings and avoid redundant embeddings API calls.
- Added live Graph Explorer status refresh (manual + background polling) so rollout health, alarms, and quality gate data stay current without page reloads.
- Added keyboard-accessible graph canvas interactions in Graph Explorer (focusable node/edge controls with Enter/Space activation and ARIA labels).
- Updated Graph Explorer node switching to cancel stale `/api/graph/explore` requests using `AbortController`, reducing redundant in-flight fetches during rapid navigation.
- Stabilized Graph Explorer wheel zoom behavior so rapid scroll events compose against the latest viewport state without dropping zoom steps.
- Clamped Graph Explorer mini-map viewport geometry at low zoom to keep viewport bounds inside the graph canvas extent.
- Added Graph Explorer interaction logic tests (filtering, selected-edge fallback, zoom/minimap math, and node-stat summaries).
- Persisted Graph Explorer filters in URL state (edge/node type selections, thresholds, evidence-only) for shareable deep links.
- Added multi-key API key management: users can create multiple active `mem_` keys, list key metadata, and revoke individual keys without rotating all keys.
- Updated memory graph architecture docs to document memory nodes and self-link behavior.
- Expanded graph + MCP docs with edge weight tables, contradiction/semantic extraction pipeline guidance, conflict payload schemas/examples, and skills guidance for conflict-aware agent handling.

## February 20, 2026

- Added graph default-on rollout policy docs with explicit go/no-go thresholds, baseline gap reporting, and `GRAPH_ROLLOUT_AUTOPILOT_ENABLED` behavior.
- Added default retrieval strategy policy autopilot (`GRAPH_DEFAULT_STRATEGY_AUTOPILOT_ENABLED`, default `true`) with two-window promotion (`lexical -> hybrid`) and automatic rollback on gate regression.
- Updated `context/get` and `graph/trace` to apply policy defaults when `strategy` is omitted and return retrieval-policy trace diagnostics.
- Added `retrievalPolicy` snapshot payload to `GET|POST|PATCH /api/sdk/v1/graph/rollout`.
- Added scheduled `Graph Rollout Baseline Report` automation (every 6 hours) that persists `reports/graph-rollout/{history,latest}.json` + `latest.md` with blocker trends, recommendation history, and readiness regression detection.
- Added `memories setup --minimal-local` preset for local-only onboarding with no cloud/workspace dependency.
- Added `memories doctor --local-only` to skip cloud checks and provide cleaner local-mode diagnostics.
- Documented a 10-minute local happy path (`setup -> doctor --local-only -> add -> search`) across CLI and Getting Started docs.
- Added `Local Onboarding Smoke` GitHub Actions workflow to validate clean-machine minimal-local onboarding on CLI-related PRs.

## February 16, 2026

## February 14, 2026

- Released `@memories.sh/cli` v0.7.6 and `@memories.sh/core` v0.3.2.
- Fixed `older_than_days` float handling — values like `0.5` now round up to `1` instead of silently flooring to `0`.
- Replaced O(n) graph mapping cleanup with batched `IN`-clause deletes for `bulk_forget_memories`.
- Optimized `bulk_forget_memories` dry run to use a single bounded query instead of unbounded `COUNT(*)`.
- Empty filter arrays (`types: []`, `tags: []`) are now correctly treated as no filter instead of bypassing validation.
- Improved error messages to clarify that `project_id` alone is not a sufficient filter for bulk operations.
- Updated tags documentation to warn about substring matching (e.g., `"test"` also matches `"testing"`).
- Updated pattern documentation to clarify glob syntax (`*` and `?`) instead of SQL LIKE.

## February 13, 2026

- Added `bulk_forget_memories` tool and `POST /api/sdk/v1/memories/bulk-forget` endpoint for filtered mass soft-deletion of memories by type, tags, age, content pattern, or project. Supports `dry_run` mode for previewing matches before deleting.
- Added `vacuum_memories` tool and `POST /api/sdk/v1/memories/vacuum` endpoint for permanently purging all soft-deleted records to reclaim storage space.
- Added `client.memories.bulkForget()` and `client.memories.vacuum()` methods to `@memories.sh/core`.
- Added `bulkForgetMemories()` and `vacuumMemories()` tool wrappers to `@memories.sh/ai-sdk`.
- MCP server now exposes 9 tools (up from 7).

## February 12, 2026

- Added workspace-level graph rollout controls with `off`, `shadow`, and `canary` modes.
- Added shadow rollout metrics and fallback safety alarms (`HIGH_FALLBACK_RATE`, `GRAPH_EXPANSION_ERRORS`) to graph status reporting.
- Added retrieval quality evals (current vs previous window) and hard canary gate enforcement (`CANARY_ROLLOUT_BLOCKED`) when fallback/relevance metrics regress.
- Added organization audit logs/event trail with storage migration, `/api/orgs/[orgId]/audit` endpoint, and Team dashboard audit panel.
- Added SDK HTTP rollout endpoint docs and hybrid retrieval trace guidance, including applied strategy + fallback diagnostics.
- Added dedicated SDK graph documentation: architecture overview and graph operations runbook.
- Upgraded dashboard graph explorer with focus mode, filter controls, fit view, mini-map, and deep-linkable node/edge state.
- Added guided CLI setup mode selection (`auto` / `local` / `cloud`) and upgraded `memories doctor --json` with stable check codes, categories, and aggregated next-step remediation.
- Added workspace-switch performance budgets (p50 ≤ 400ms, p95 ≤ 1000ms over 24h) with integration-health alerts and CI enforcement for budget evaluation logic.
- Added automatic GitHub capture intake (PRs, issues, commits) with dashboard review/approval queue before writing to memory.
- Added Actionable Intelligence dashboard panel with stale-rule detection, conflict candidates, weekly change summary, and suggested archive/merge/relabel actions.
- Added one-click Actionable Intelligence apply flow (`archive`, `merge`, `relabel`) with backend execution API and immediate dashboard memory-list updates.
- Optimized workspace switching with cached workspace-summary API responses, switcher prefetch for personal/org summaries, and batched org-member login lookups to remove per-member N+1 auth requests.
- Expanded GitHub auto-capture depth with release-note webhook adapters (`release` events) and richer queue filters (`event`, `repo`, `actor`, `workspace`, `q`) for review workflows.

## February 11, 2026

- Updated OpenClaw integration docs to follow workspace onboarding (`openclaw onboard`) with generated artifacts in `~/.openclaw/workspace` (`AGENTS.md` and `skills/`).
- Clarified that OpenClaw integration is documented via workspace artifacts, not `.openclaw/mcp.json`.

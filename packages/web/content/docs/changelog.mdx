## February 20, 2026

- Removed legacy tenant management routes `/api/mcp/tenants` and `/api/sdk/v1/management/tenants`.
- Removed legacy tenant compatibility wrapper code and telemetry write-paths now that traffic is zero.
- Updated tenant-routing and SDK endpoint contract docs to reference only `/api/sdk/v1/management/tenant-overrides`.
- Added hosted SDK embeddings docs at `/docs/sdk/embeddings` with write-path model selection, retrieval strategy controls, and migration guidance.
- Added embeddings endpoint contract documentation for:
  - `GET /api/sdk/v1/embeddings/models`
  - `GET /api/sdk/v1/management/embeddings/usage`
  - `GET|POST /api/sdk/v1/management/embeddings/backfill`
  - `GET /api/sdk/v1/management/embeddings/observability`
- Documented retrieval strategy defaults for `context/get` and `memories/search` as `lexical`, with compatibility aliases:
  - `baseline` -> `lexical`
  - `hybrid_graph` -> `hybrid`
- Documented `embeddingModel` request support on `memories/add` and `memories/edit`, including response metadata (`embeddingModel`, `embeddingModelSource`).
- Clarified retrieval `trace` diagnostics and fallback semantics to support phased semantic/hybrid rollout.

## February 16, 2026

- Deprecated legacy tenant management routes: `/api/mcp/tenants` and `/api/sdk/v1/management/tenants`.
- Moved both legacy tenant paths to compatibility wrappers over `/api/sdk/v1/management/tenant-overrides`.
- Added consistent deprecation headers (`Deprecation`, `Sunset`, `Link`, `Warning`) for legacy tenant route responses.
- Added server-side legacy route telemetry table (`legacy_route_usage_events`) to track migration progress to zero traffic before removal.
- Published sunset timeline and migration guide at `/docs/sdk/legacy-tenant-route-sunset`.

## February 14, 2026

- Released `@memories.sh/cli` v0.7.6 and `@memories.sh/core` v0.3.2.
- Fixed `older_than_days` float handling — values like `0.5` now round up to `1` instead of silently flooring to `0`.
- Replaced O(n) graph mapping cleanup with batched `IN`-clause deletes for `bulk_forget_memories`.
- Optimized `bulk_forget_memories` dry run to use a single bounded query instead of unbounded `COUNT(*)`.
- Empty filter arrays (`types: []`, `tags: []`) are now correctly treated as no filter instead of bypassing validation.
- Improved error messages to clarify that `project_id` alone is not a sufficient filter for bulk operations.
- Updated tags documentation to warn about substring matching (e.g., `"test"` also matches `"testing"`).
- Updated pattern documentation to clarify glob syntax (`*` and `?`) instead of SQL LIKE.

## February 13, 2026

- Added `bulk_forget_memories` tool and `POST /api/sdk/v1/memories/bulk-forget` endpoint for filtered mass soft-deletion of memories by type, tags, age, content pattern, or project. Supports `dry_run` mode for previewing matches before deleting.
- Added `vacuum_memories` tool and `POST /api/sdk/v1/memories/vacuum` endpoint for permanently purging all soft-deleted records to reclaim storage space.
- Added `client.memories.bulkForget()` and `client.memories.vacuum()` methods to `@memories.sh/core`.
- Added `bulkForgetMemories()` and `vacuumMemories()` tool wrappers to `@memories.sh/ai-sdk`.
- MCP server now exposes 9 tools (up from 7).

## February 12, 2026

- Added workspace-level graph rollout controls with `off`, `shadow`, and `canary` modes.
- Added shadow rollout metrics and fallback safety alarms (`HIGH_FALLBACK_RATE`, `GRAPH_EXPANSION_ERRORS`) to graph status reporting.
- Added retrieval quality evals (current vs previous window) and hard canary gate enforcement (`CANARY_ROLLOUT_BLOCKED`) when fallback/relevance metrics regress.
- Added organization audit logs/event trail with storage migration, `/api/orgs/[orgId]/audit` endpoint, and Team dashboard audit panel.
- Added SDK HTTP rollout endpoint docs and hybrid retrieval trace guidance, including applied strategy + fallback diagnostics.
- Added dedicated SDK graph documentation: architecture overview and graph operations runbook.
- Upgraded dashboard graph explorer with focus mode, filter controls, fit view, mini-map, and deep-linkable node/edge state.
- Added guided CLI setup mode selection (`auto` / `local` / `cloud`) and upgraded `memories doctor --json` with stable check codes, categories, and aggregated next-step remediation.
- Added workspace-switch performance budgets (p50 ≤ 400ms, p95 ≤ 1000ms over 24h) with integration-health alerts and CI enforcement for budget evaluation logic.
- Added automatic GitHub capture intake (PRs, issues, commits) with dashboard review/approval queue before writing to memory.
- Added Actionable Intelligence dashboard panel with stale-rule detection, conflict candidates, weekly change summary, and suggested archive/merge/relabel actions.
- Added one-click Actionable Intelligence apply flow (`archive`, `merge`, `relabel`) with backend execution API and immediate dashboard memory-list updates.
- Optimized workspace switching with cached workspace-summary API responses, switcher prefetch for personal/org summaries, and batched org-member login lookups to remove per-member N+1 auth requests.
- Expanded GitHub auto-capture depth with release-note webhook adapters (`release` events) and richer queue filters (`event`, `repo`, `actor`, `workspace`, `q`) for review workflows.

## February 11, 2026

- Updated OpenClaw integration docs to follow workspace onboarding (`openclaw onboard`) with generated artifacts in `~/.openclaw/workspace` (`AGENTS.md` and `skills/`).
- Clarified that OpenClaw integration is documented via workspace artifacts, not `.openclaw/mcp.json`.

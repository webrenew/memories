- Added SDK HTTP rollout endpoint docs and hybrid retrieval trace guidance, including applied strategy + fallback diagnostics.
- Added dedicated SDK graph documentation: architecture overview and graph operations runbook.
- Upgraded dashboard graph explorer with focus mode, filter controls, fit view, mini-map, and deep-linkable node/edge state.
- Added guided CLI setup mode selection (`auto` / `local` / `cloud`) and upgraded `memories doctor --json` with stable check codes, categories, and aggregated next-step remediation.
- Added workspace-switch performance budgets (p50 ≤ 400ms, p95 ≤ 1000ms over 24h) with integration-health alerts and CI enforcement for budget evaluation logic.

## February 11, 2026

- Updated OpenClaw integration docs to follow workspace onboarding (`openclaw onboard`) with generated artifacts in `~/.openclaw/workspace` (`AGENTS.md` and `skills/`).
- Clarified that OpenClaw integration is documented via workspace artifacts, not `.openclaw/mcp.json`.

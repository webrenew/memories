## February 12, 2026

- Added workspace-level graph rollout controls with `off`, `shadow`, and `canary` modes.
- Added shadow rollout metrics and fallback safety alarms (`HIGH_FALLBACK_RATE`, `GRAPH_EXPANSION_ERRORS`) to graph status reporting.
- Added retrieval quality evals (current vs previous window) and hard canary gate enforcement (`CANARY_ROLLOUT_BLOCKED`) when fallback/relevance metrics regress.
- Added organization audit logs/event trail with storage migration, `/api/orgs/[orgId]/audit` endpoint, and Team dashboard audit panel.
- Added SDK HTTP rollout endpoint docs and hybrid retrieval trace guidance, including applied strategy + fallback diagnostics.
- Added dedicated SDK graph documentation: architecture overview and graph operations runbook.
- Upgraded dashboard graph explorer with focus mode, filter controls, fit view, mini-map, and deep-linkable node/edge state.
- Added guided CLI setup mode selection (`auto` / `local` / `cloud`) and upgraded `memories doctor --json` with stable check codes, categories, and aggregated next-step remediation.
- Added workspace-switch performance budgets (p50 ≤ 400ms, p95 ≤ 1000ms over 24h) with integration-health alerts and CI enforcement for budget evaluation logic.
- Added automatic GitHub capture intake (PRs, issues, commits) with dashboard review/approval queue before writing to memory.
- Added Actionable Intelligence dashboard panel with stale-rule detection, conflict candidates, weekly change summary, and suggested archive/merge/relabel actions.
- Added one-click Actionable Intelligence apply flow (`archive`, `merge`, `relabel`) with backend execution API and immediate dashboard memory-list updates.
- Optimized workspace switching with cached workspace-summary API responses, switcher prefetch for personal/org summaries, and batched org-member login lookups to remove per-member N+1 auth requests.
- Expanded GitHub auto-capture depth with release-note webhook adapters (`release` events) and richer queue filters (`event`, `repo`, `actor`, `workspace`, `q`) for review workflows.

## February 11, 2026

- Updated OpenClaw integration docs to follow workspace onboarding (`openclaw onboard`) with generated artifacts in `~/.openclaw/workspace` (`AGENTS.md` and `skills/`).
- Clarified that OpenClaw integration is documented via workspace artifacts, not `.openclaw/mcp.json`.

title: Memory Types
description: Understanding the five memory types — rules, decisions, facts, notes, and skills.
---

Every memory in memories.sh has a **type** that describes its purpose. The type affects how the memory is presented to AI agents and how it's prioritized in context.

<Callout>
Types answer "what kind of memory is this?" (`rule`, `decision`, `fact`, `note`, `skill`).
For lifecycle segmentation (session vs semantic vs episodic vs procedural), see
[Memory Segmentation](/docs/concepts/memory-segmentation).

## Types

### Rule

Rules are always-active coding standards, preferences, and constraints. They are **always included** when context is requested, regardless of the query.

```bash
memories add --rule "Always use TypeScript strict mode"
memories add --rule "Prefer named exports over default exports"
memories add --rule "Use early returns to reduce nesting"
```

Rules are the most important memory type. They appear at the top of generated files and are always returned by `memories recall` and the MCP `get_context` tool.

Rules can be **path-scoped** so they only apply to specific files:

```bash
memories add --rule "Use RESTful naming conventions" --paths "src/api/**"
memories add --rule "Mock all external services" --paths "**/*.test.ts"
```

### Decision

Decisions capture the reasoning behind architectural and technical choices. They help AI agents understand **why** something was done a certain way.

```bash
memories add --decision "Chose PostgreSQL over MySQL for JSONB support and better array handling"
memories add --decision "Using Supabase for auth because of built-in RLS and generous free tier"
```

### Fact

Facts store specific project knowledge — numbers, configurations, constraints, and other concrete information.

```bash
memories add --fact "API rate limit is 100 requests per minute per user"
memories add --fact "The main database runs PostgreSQL 15 on Supabase"
memories add --fact "Deploy target is Vercel with Edge Functions"
```

### Note

Notes are the default type for general-purpose memories that don't fit the other categories.

```bash
memories add "Legacy API will be deprecated in Q3 2026"
memories add "The billing module was written by the contractor team"
```

### Skill

Skills define reusable capabilities or workflows that AI agents can invoke. They follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard and generate `SKILL.md` files in the `.agents/skills/` directory.

```bash
memories add --type skill "## Deploy to Production\n\n1. Run tests\n2. Build artifacts\n3. Push to registry" \
  --category deploy \
  --metadata '{"name": "deploy", "description": "Deploy the app to production"}'
```

Skills require a `--category` to group them into directories (e.g., `deploy`, `review`, `testing`). The category becomes the skill's folder name in `.agents/skills/{category}/SKILL.md`.

## Extended Fields

In addition to the type, memories can carry optional metadata that enriches generated configurations:

### paths

Comma-separated glob patterns that scope a memory to specific files. When set, the memory only appears in path-scoped rule files rather than global instructions.

```bash
memories add --rule "Use React Query for data fetching" --paths "src/components/**,src/hooks/**"
```

Path-scoped memories translate into:
- `.claude/rules/*.md` with `paths:` frontmatter
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` with `globs:` frontmatter
- Inline path annotations in flat-file targets

### category

A free-form grouping key. For rules, the category determines the output filename (e.g., `--category api` produces `rules/api.md`). For skills, it determines the directory name.

```bash
memories add --rule "Validate all request params" --paths "src/api/**" --category api
```

### metadata

A JSON object for extended attributes. Primarily used for skills (name, description, allowed tools), but available on any memory type for future use.

```bash
memories add --type skill "..." --metadata '{"name": "code-review", "description": "Systematic code review"}'
```

## How Types Affect Context

When an AI agent requests context via `memories recall` or the MCP server:

1. **All rules** are always included (both global and project-scoped), with path information when available
2. **Other types** are included based on search relevance or explicit request
3. Generated files include rules by default, with decisions and facts optional via `--types`

## Choosing the Right Type

| If the memory... | Use |
|-----------------|-----|
| Should always be followed | `rule` |
| Explains a past choice | `decision` |
| States something concrete and specific | `fact` |
| Is general context or temporary | `note` |
| Defines a reusable agent workflow | `skill` |

title: Memory Types
description: Understanding the four memory types — rules, decisions, facts, and notes.
---

Every memory in memories.sh has a **type** that describes its purpose. The type affects how the memory is presented to AI agents and how it's prioritized in context.

## Types

### Rule

Rules are always-active coding standards, preferences, and constraints. They are **always included** when context is requested, regardless of the query.

```bash
memories add --rule "Always use TypeScript strict mode"
memories add --rule "Prefer named exports over default exports"
memories add --rule "Use early returns to reduce nesting"
```

Rules are the most important memory type. They appear at the top of generated files and are always returned by `memories recall` and the MCP `get_context` tool.

### Decision

Decisions capture the reasoning behind architectural and technical choices. They help AI agents understand **why** something was done a certain way.

```bash
memories add --decision "Chose PostgreSQL over MySQL for JSONB support and better array handling"
memories add --decision "Using Supabase for auth because of built-in RLS and generous free tier"
```

### Fact

Facts store specific project knowledge — numbers, configurations, constraints, and other concrete information.

```bash
memories add --fact "API rate limit is 100 requests per minute per user"
memories add --fact "The main database runs PostgreSQL 15 on Supabase"
memories add --fact "Deploy target is Vercel with Edge Functions"
```

### Note

Notes are the default type for general-purpose memories that don't fit the other categories.

```bash
memories add "Legacy API will be deprecated in Q3 2026"
memories add "The billing module was written by the contractor team"
```

## How Types Affect Context

When an AI agent requests context via `memories recall` or the MCP server:

1. **All rules** are always included (both global and project-scoped)
2. **Other types** are included based on search relevance or explicit request
3. Generated files include rules by default, with decisions and facts optional via `--types`

## Choosing the Right Type

| If the memory... | Use |
|-----------------|-----|
| Should always be followed | `rule` |
| Explains a past choice | `decision` |
| States something concrete and specific | `fact` |
| Is general context or temporary | `note` |

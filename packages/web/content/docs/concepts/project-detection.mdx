title: Project Detection
description: How memories.sh identifies and scopes to the current project using git.
---

memories.sh uses the git remote URL to identify the current project. This happens automatically — no configuration needed.

## How It Works

When you run a command inside a git repository, memories.sh:

1. Reads the `origin` remote URL from git
2. Normalizes the URL to a canonical project ID
3. Uses this ID to scope memories to the project

## URL Normalization

Both SSH and HTTPS URLs are normalized to the same project ID:

| Remote URL | Project ID |
|-----------|------------|
| `git@github.com:user/repo.git` | `github.com/user/repo` |
| `https://github.com/user/repo.git` | `github.com/user/repo` |
| `git@gitlab.com:org/project.git` | `gitlab.com/org/project` |

The `.git` suffix is stripped, and the protocol/auth prefix is removed. This means the same repository always gets the same project ID regardless of how it was cloned.

## When There's No Git Repo

If you're not inside a git repository:
- Memories default to **global** scope
- The `--global` flag is implied
- `memories doctor` will report that project detection is inactive

## Checking Project Detection

Use `memories doctor` to verify that project detection is working:

```bash
memories doctor
```

Look for the "Git project detection" check in the output. It will show the detected project ID or report that no git repo was found.

You can also see the project ID in `memories stats` output.

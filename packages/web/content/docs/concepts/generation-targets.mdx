title: Generation Targets
description: How memories.sh generates native config files for each AI tool.
---

The `memories generate` command creates native configuration files that each AI tool understands natively. Each target has its own format, file location, and quirks.

## Supported Targets

### Cursor

- **Path:** `.cursor/rules/memories.mdc`
- **Format:** MDC (Markdown with YAML frontmatter)
- Cursor reads `.mdc` files from `.cursor/rules/` and applies them as project rules

### Claude Code

- **Path:** `CLAUDE.md`
- **Format:** Markdown
- Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` from the project root as its instruction file

### Agents (Multi-tool)

- **Path:** `AGENTS.md`
- **Format:** Markdown
- Used by Amp, Codex, Goose, Kilo, Kiro, and OpenCode

### GitHub Copilot

- **Path:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Format:** Markdown
- Copilot reads instructions from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### Windsurf

- **Path:** `.windsurf/rules/memories.md`
- **Format:** Markdown
- Has a 6000 character limit — content is truncated if it exceeds this

### Cline

- **Path:** `.clinerules/memories.md`
- **Format:** Markdown

### Roo

- **Path:** `.roo/rules/memories.md`
- **Format:** Markdown

### Gemini

- **Path:** `GEMINI.md`
- **Format:** Markdown

## File Marker

All generated files include a marker comment:

```
<!-- Generated by memories.sh at 2026-01-15T10:30:00Z -->
```

This marker serves two purposes:
1. **Overwrite protection** — `memories generate` won't overwrite files without this marker unless `--force` is used
2. **Ingest detection** — `memories ingest` skips files with this marker to avoid circular imports

## Gitignore Recommendations

After generating files, memories.sh may suggest adding tool-specific directories to `.gitignore`. Whether you commit generated files is up to you:

- **Commit them** if you want the rules visible to collaborators who don't use memories.sh
- **Gitignore them** if all team members use memories.sh and generate locally

description: How global and project scopes determine which memories apply where.
---

Every memory has a **scope** that determines where it applies: globally across all projects, or only within a specific project.

## Global Scope

Global memories apply to all projects. Use them for personal coding standards and preferences that you want enforced everywhere.

```bash
memories add --global --rule "Use conventional commits"
memories add --global --rule "Prefer functional patterns over class-based"
```

Memories are stored as global when:
- The `--global` flag is passed
- You're not inside a git repository

## Project Scope

Project memories only apply to the current project. They're automatically scoped when you're inside a git repository.

```bash
# Inside a git repo — automatically project-scoped
memories add --rule "Use pnpm as the package manager"
memories add --decision "Chose Tailwind CSS for this project"
```

Project identity is derived from the `origin` git remote URL. See [Project Detection](/docs/concepts/project-detection) for details.

## How Scopes Interact

When you request context (via `recall`, `prompt`, `generate`, or the MCP server), memories.sh merges both scopes:

1. **Global memories** are always included
2. **Project memories** for the current project are included when inside a git repo

In generated files and MCP responses, global and project memories are clearly labeled with their scope.

## Scope in Commands

Most commands that read memories include both scopes by default. You can filter:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--global` | Only global memories |
| `--project-only` | Only project memories (exclude global) |
| *(neither)* | Both scopes |

```bash
memories list --global            # Only global
memories list --project-only      # Only current project
memories search "auth"            # Both scopes
```

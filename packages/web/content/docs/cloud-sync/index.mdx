title: Cloud Sync
description: Sync memories across devices with cloud-backed storage.
---

Cloud sync lets you access your memories from any machine. It uses Turso embedded replicas — your local SQLite database is the primary copy, with changes syncing to a cloud database.

## Setup

### 1. Log In

```bash
memories login
```

This opens your browser to authenticate with memories.sh. Your credentials are saved to `~/.config/memories/auth.json`.

### 2. Enable Sync

```bash
memories sync enable
```

This provisions a cloud database and reconfigures your local database as an embedded replica. Your existing memories are preserved.

### 3. Push Changes

```bash
memories sync push
```

Push any local changes to the cloud. On other devices, enabling sync will pull down the latest state.

## How It Works

- **Local-first** — The local SQLite database is always the primary copy. You can work offline.
- **Embedded replicas** — Uses Turso's embedded replica mode with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) for efficient sync.
- **Manual push** — Changes are pushed explicitly with `memories sync push`. There's no automatic background sync.

## Check Status

```bash
memories sync status
```

Shows the remote database URL, organization, and database name.

## Prerequisites

- A memories.sh account (sign up at [memories.sh](https://memories.sh))
- Active internet connection for the initial setup and push operations

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────┐        ┌──────────────┐
│  Machine A   │        │  Machine B   │
│  local.db    │───────▶│  local.db    │
│  (replica)   │   ▲    │  (replica)   │
└──────────────┘   │    └──────────────┘
                   │
            ┌──────┴──────┐
            │ Cloud (Turso)│
            │  remote.db   │
            └─────────────┘
```

Each machine maintains a local embedded replica that syncs with the cloud database. Push from any machine, pull from any other.

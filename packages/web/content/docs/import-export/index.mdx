title: Import & Export
description: Move memories between machines, share with teams, and migrate from existing setups.

memories.sh provides three ways to move data in and out:

- **Export/Import** — Portable JSON or YAML for backup, sharing, and migration
- **Ingest** — Extract memories from existing IDE rule files

## Export Memories

Export your memories to a portable format:

```bash
# Export all to JSON
memories export -o backup.json

# Export project rules to YAML
memories export --project-only --type rule -f yaml -o rules.yaml

# Export to stdout
memories export | jq '.memories | length'
```

See [`memories export`](/docs/cli/export) for full options.

## Import Memories

Import from a previously exported file:

```bash
# Import from JSON
memories import backup.json

# Preview what would be imported
memories import shared-rules.json --dry-run

# Import all as global
memories import team-standards.json --global
```

See [`memories import`](/docs/cli/import) for full options.

## Ingest from IDE Files

Already have rules in `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, or other IDE config files? Ingest extracts and imports them:

```bash
# Ingest from a specific tool
memories ingest cursor
memories ingest claude

# Scan all known locations
memories ingest --all

# Preview first
memories ingest --all --dry-run
```

The ingester:
- Extracts bullet points, numbered items, and significant paragraphs
- Auto-classifies content as rules, decisions, or facts based on keywords
- Deduplicates against existing memories
- Skips files that were generated by memories.sh

See [`memories ingest`](/docs/cli/ingest) for full options.

## Sharing with Teams

To share a set of team standards:

1. Export the rules you want to share:
   ```bash
   memories export --global --type rule -o team-rules.json
   ```

2. Share the file (commit it, send it, etc.)

3. Team members import it:
   ```bash
   memories import team-rules.json --global
   ```

description: Auto-generate IDE rule files on every commit with git hooks.
---

Install a git hook to automatically regenerate IDE config files whenever you commit. This ensures your generated files always reflect the latest state of your memories.

## Quick Setup

```bash
memories hook install
```

This installs a pre-commit hook that runs `memories generate all --force` and stages the generated files before each commit.

## How It Works

The hook:
1. Runs `memories generate all --force` to regenerate all target files
2. Stages the generated files with `git add`
3. The commit proceeds with the updated files included

## Hook Detection

The installer automatically detects your git hooks setup:

| Setup | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Husky v9+ | `.husky/pre-commit` |
| Husky v4–8 | `.husky/pre-commit` |
| Plain git | `.git/hooks/pre-commit` |

If an existing hook file is found, the memories section is appended (not overwritten).

## Uninstall

```bash
memories hook uninstall
```

This removes only the memories-specific section from the hook. If the hook file contained only the memories section, the file is deleted entirely.

## Check Status

```bash
memories hook status
```

Reports whether the memories hook is installed and where.

## lint-staged Integration

If lint-staged is detected in your project, the installer suggests adding memories generation to your lint-staged config instead:

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*": "memories generate all --force"
  }
}
```

This approach integrates with your existing pre-commit workflow rather than adding a separate hook.

## Custom Hook Name

By default, memories uses the `pre-commit` hook. You can specify a different hook:

```bash
memories hook install --hook pre-push
memories hook uninstall --hook pre-push
memories hook status --hook pre-push
```

See [`memories hook`](/docs/cli/hook) for the full CLI reference.

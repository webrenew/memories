# Memory Segmentation Launch Kit

Date: 2026-02-28

## Website/Demo Blurb

memories.sh now uses a segmented memory lifecycle for agents: session memory for active work, semantic memory for durable truths, episodic memory for timeline fidelity, and procedural memory for reusable workflows. This gives teams compaction-safe continuity without replaying entire transcripts.

## Changelog Snippet

Shipped segmented memory lifecycle messaging and docs across the site, including a new Memory Segmentation concept guide, homepage copy refresh, lifecycle command updates in Getting Started/README, and integration runbooks for SDK, MCP, and OpenClaw.

## Social Post Draft

We just shipped segmented agent memory docs + UX at memories.sh.

- Session memory for active context
- Semantic memory for durable truths
- Episodic memory for logs + raw snapshots
- Procedural memory for reusable workflows

Also added lifecycle flows for SDK, MCP, and OpenClaw with compaction-safe checkpoints.

## Email Update Draft

Subject: Segmented memory lifecycle is now live in memories.sh docs

We just rolled out a full lifecycle memory update across memories.sh docs and site copy.

What’s new:

1. A dedicated Memory Segmentation concept guide
2. Session + compaction commands highlighted in Getting Started and README
3. Lifecycle-first integration patterns for SDK, MCP, and OpenClaw
4. Homepage messaging now aligned to session, semantic, episodic, and procedural memory

## Sales/Support One-Liner

memories.sh is not just a memory store; it is a segmented lifecycle system that keeps active sessions coherent while preserving durable semantic, episodic, and procedural memory over time.
